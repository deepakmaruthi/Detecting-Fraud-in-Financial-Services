# Detecting-Fraud-in-Financial-Services
Built a comprehensive fraud detection system using XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Bayesian networks to improve detection efficiency across credit card, insurance, and securities domains.
üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Detection in Financial Services With the rapid evolution of digital technologies, fraudsters have found increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit financial systems‚Äîparticularly through credit card misuse and automated internet bots. The rise of digital banking has introduced new fraud patterns that are difficult for traditional human-based monitoring systems to detect due to the speed, scale, and complexity of these activities.

To address this challenge, I developed Oddity, a smart fraud detection system designed to analyze user behavior and identify unusual patterns that may signal fraudulent activity. By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, Oddity learns from historical transaction data to flag anomalies in real-time, offering a proactive layer of protection against evolving threats.

This project uses a simulated dataset tailored for fraud detection research, sourced from PaySim.
